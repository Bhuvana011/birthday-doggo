So, I started brainstorming about what project I should make for woof. Then I thought about a website bc I recently got into web-development! 

Eventually, I decided to make a website about the dog breeds I wanted for my birthday bc I rly rly want a dogggo!

First I created a intro page to see if someone even wanted to even know about me. The only answer was yes lol.

Obvi it had to have a blahaj on it that I edited to have dog ears! If you click on the image you go to a YT video of a dog with a butteryful on it's nose: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fnbd5z8kJFk&t=7s

I pixaldifed it a bit more and added a cute cute things!

Next I decided to create a page that actually introduces what this website is going to be about: dog breeds I want for my birthday.

On the page there are multiple pawprints that if someone clicks on they learn about the dog breed I wany & why I want it.

Also there are bows on the page if you click on, calm cute music plays. On the bottom of the page there is an animation of dog blahaj swimming across the screen :3!!
Alsoo, there is a golden paw print that teaches one more about no-kill shelters and project fluffy(a project I did to increase volunteering for a local no-kill animal shelter).

Btw: I drew the bow, paw prints, and the dog ears on blahaj.

ALSO, THE CURSOR ON ALL THESE PAGES IS A DOGGO I DREW!!

The pages I created for the dog breeds I wanted were for: a golden retriever, Bernese Mountain Dog, Standard Poodle, and American Pit Bull Terrier. 
These pages had a image under the creative commons liscense of a doggo of that breed. If you click on the image a bark comes.

Also on these pages was a paw print I drew that if you click on them,  a funny silly video of the doggo breed pops up on a seperate page!

Ok so final page is about no-kill shelters, what they are, and why one should support them. Plus, its also about project fluffy and all the things I did to support Dog & Kitty
City (a local no-kill shelter near me). It has a ton of photos of me, doggos, and a few cats!
