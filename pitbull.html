        <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Pitbulls are such cuddly, smile-y, happy doggos. I would definitely name mine earthquaker causer because look at how powerful and silly they look. They are super loyal, affectionate, smart, and playful. But, unfortunatley there are a lot of myths surrounding this cute doggo breed. Specifically, that they are super aggressive. This is very wrong! They are not at all mean, but more happy! I would love to get one because just look at their smiles!</h4>
